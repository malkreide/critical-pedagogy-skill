  (2) analyze school communication (parent letters, mission statements, policies)
  for implicit assumptions, (3) asks about power analysis, ideology critique,
  Critical Pedagogy, hidden curriculum, or perspective analysis,
  (4) wants to question school structures for systemic disadvantage,
  (5) wants to check texts for blind spots, missing voices, or hegemonic
  narratives, or (6) requests a critical-pedagogical reflection on an
  educational topic. Also for diversity audits, selection process analysis,
  and developing inclusive school cultures.

# Critical-Pedagogical Analysis: Education, Power, and Emancipation

This skill implements a structured analytical methodology that systematically
examines educational texts, curricula, school structures, and communication for
hidden power dynamics, exclusion mechanisms, and normative assumptions.

The theoretical foundation draws on Critical Theory (Frankfurt School:
Horkheimer, Adorno, Habermas, Honneth) and Critical Pedagogy (Paulo Freire,
Henry Giroux, bell hooks). The skill translates this intellectual tradition into
a practical tool for teachers, school leaders, and education administrators.

## Core Principle

**No text is neutral. Every educational document conveys — consciously or
unconsciously — assumptions about who is "normal," what "good learning" means,
and whose knowledge counts. Make these assumptions visible.**

This does not mean every text is "bad." It means that critical reflection is
a prerequisite for conscious, inclusive educational practice.

> "Education is never neutral. It is either an instrument for the integration
> of the younger generation into the logic of the present system — or it
> becomes the practice of freedom." — Paulo Freire (paraphrased)

## Theoretical Framework (Quick Reference)

The skill operates with concepts from four intellectual traditions. Claude does
not need to fully elaborate these in every analysis, but they form the analytical
foundation and can be explicitly referenced when needed.

| Tradition | Core Concept | Application in Skill |
|---|---|---|
| **Frankfurt School** (Horkheimer/Adorno) | Instrumental reason, culture industry, ideology critique | Analysis of how education systems shape people into "functioning" units rather than autonomous subjects |
| **Habermas** | Colonization of the lifeworld, communicative reason | Analysis of how economic logics (efficiency, measurability, competition) penetrate pedagogical spaces |
| **Honneth** | Recognition and disrespect | Analysis of which identities are recognized in educational texts, which are overlooked or devalued |
| **Freire** | Banking concept, conscientização, dialogical pedagogy | Analysis of whether educational practices treat learners as subjects or as passive recipients |

## Context Adaptation: Swiss Education System

This skill is calibrated for the context of Swiss public schools (particularly
the City of Zurich). This means:

**Specific Framework Conditions:**
- Federal education system with cantonal authority and municipal implementation
- Lehrplan 21 (Curriculum 21) as the normative framework (competency-based education)
- Self-managed schools with high autonomy of school leaders
- Cultural and linguistic diversity as the norm (not as an exception)
- Democratic participation (district school boards, parent involvement)

**Relevant Legal Frameworks (reference frame, not legal review):**
- Volksschulgesetz (Public School Act) of the Canton of Zurich (VSG) and
  Volksschulverordnung (Public School Ordinance, VSV)
- Verordnung über die geleiteten Volksschulen (Ordinance on Self-Managed
  Public Schools, VGV)
- Lehrplan 21 (Curriculum 21), Canton of Zurich
- UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly Art. 12 (right to
  be heard), Art. 28 (right to education), Art. 29 (aims of education)
- Swiss Federal Constitution Art. 11 (protection of children and young
  people), Art. 19 (right to basic education)
- Behindertengleichstellungsgesetz (Disability Equality Act, BehiG)
- Municipal Code of the City of Zurich (municipal school organization)

Claude is not a lawyer and does not conduct legal compliance reviews. The legal
frameworks serve as a reference to contextualize normative findings (e.g., "The
absence of child participation in report card discussions stands in tension
with Art. 12 UNCRC"). For concrete legal clarification needs, refer to
specialized services.

**Note for international users:** While this skill is calibrated for the Swiss
context, the analytical methodology is universally applicable. When analyzing
texts from other educational systems, replace the Swiss legal references with
the relevant local legal frameworks (e.g., IDEA/Title IX in the US, Equality
Act in the UK, Schulgesetz in German federal states). The five analytical steps
and the theoretical framework remain the same.

**Calibrated Stance:**
- Critique is constructive, not destructive. The goal is improvement, not accusation.
- Systemic analysis does not replace individual blame. Teachers act within
  structures — the skill analyzes the structures, not the persons.
- Legal and democratic foundations are framework conditions to be respected.
  Critique targets *interpretation* and *implementation*, not the democratic
  process itself.
- Swiss pragmatism: Analysis leads to actionable recommendations, not pure theory.

## The 5 Analysis Steps + Overall Assessment

Guide the user sequentially through all five steps. The sequence matters because
each step builds on the previous one. Do not skip any step, but adjust the
depth to the context (a parent letter needs less depth than a curriculum).

### Data Quality Indicator

Mark each assessment with its **data quality:**
- 🔵 **Evidenced** — assessment based on verifiable facts (textual evidence,
  published studies, legal frameworks, documented practice)
- ⚪ **Estimate** — assessment based on plausibility assumptions, analogical
  reasoning, or the analyst's professional experience

This indicator is important for further use: Recommendations based on
⚪ estimates require validation (e.g., through consultation with affected
parties, data collection, or team discussion). Actively point out to the user
where the analysis relies on assumptions rather than evidence.

### Step 1: Contextualization — "Who speaks, to whom, for what purpose?"

**Imperative:** Before analyzing content, clarify the context. A text means
something different depending on who wrote it, who it addresses, and what
institutional purpose it serves.

**Guiding Questions:**
1. **Authorship:** Who wrote this text? What institutional position do the
   authors hold? (School leadership, authority, publisher, teacher?)
2. **Addressee:** Who is the text aimed at? Who is explicitly addressed —
   and who is implicitly included or excluded?
3. **Functional Context:** What is the text supposed to achieve? (Inform,
   norm-set, legitimize, motivate, select?)
4. **Historical Context:** When and under what circumstances was the text
   created? What educational policy discourses were dominant?
5. **Institutional Framework:** What power position does the issuing
   institution hold? Can the addressees influence the text or only receive it?

**Legal Framework Check (optional, where relevant):**
Name the most important legal and normative reference frameworks applicable
to the analyzed text. Not as a legal review, but as orientation: What rights
and obligations are affected? Are there legally anchored entitlements (e.g.,
child's right to be heard, right to accommodations) that can serve as a
benchmark in the further analysis?

**Output:** A brief context section (3–5 sentences) that names the power
differential between sender and receiver, clarifies the functional framework,
and where applicable references relevant legal frameworks.

---

**⚠️ DIALOGUE POINT: Stop here and ask the user a follow-up question before
proceeding to Step 2.** Possible questions:
- Is the contextualization accurate? Is there background information (e.g.,
  "This parent letter was revised after a parent council meeting")?
- Which perspectives (Step 4) are particularly relevant in the specific context?
- Should the analysis focus on particular aspects, or is there a specific
  reason for the analysis?

**Exception:** Skip the follow-up question only if the user has *explicitly*
requested a complete analysis without interruption.

---

### Step 2: Normativity Analysis — "What is set as 'normal'?"

**Imperative:** Every educational text contains implicit assumptions about what
"normal" learning, "normal" families, "normal" children are. These norms are
often invisible because they are taken for granted. Make them visible.

**Guiding Questions:**
1. **Subject Image:** What child is assumed as the "default case"?
   (Linguistically, cognitively, socioeconomically, culturally, physically?)
2. **Family Image:** What family structure is implicitly set as the standard?
   (Two parents? Native language speakers? Academically educated? Available
   for parent evenings?)
3. **Performance Norm:** What definition of "success" or "competence" is used?
   What counts as a "deficit"?
4. **Language Norm:** In what language/register is communication conducted?
   Who is privileged by this, who is disadvantaged?
5. **Cultural Norm:** What cultural references, holidays, examples are assumed
   as self-evident?

**Analysis Technique — "Reversal Test":** Imagine the opposite position. If a
text writes "Parents are asked to read with their children for 20 minutes
daily": What does this mean for a single parent working three jobs? The reversal
test reveals which life realities a text renders invisible.

**Output:** A list of identified normativities, each with classification and
data quality:
- ✅ **Consciously inclusive framing** — explicitly inclusive, differentiated,
  or power-critical formulation. Maintain and strengthen.
- 🔵 **Explicit norm** — openly named and justified in the text
- 🟠 **Implicit norm** — unspoken but operative
- 🔴 **Exclusionary norm** — structurally excludes specific groups

Each finding is marked with 🔵 (Evidenced) or ⚪ (Estimate).

### Step 3: Power Analysis — "Who benefits, who loses?"

**Imperative:** Analyze the distribution of power, resources, and voices.
Ask not only "What does the text say?" but "What social relations does this
text stabilize or destabilize?"

**Three Levels of Analysis (after Lukes' three dimensions of power):**

**A) Visible Power — "Who decides?"**
- Who decides what? Who has veto power?
- What roles are assigned? (active/passive, giving/receiving)
- Who evaluates whom? (Teacher evaluates students — is this questioned?)

**B) Hidden Power — "What is not discussed?"**
- What topics are addressed, what is blanked out?
- Whose knowledge counts as "school knowledge," whose as irrelevant?
- What questions may be asked, what may not?

**C) Invisible Power — "What is taken for granted, even though it is a
decision?"**
- What beliefs are conveyed as "natural" or "self-evident"?
- Is meritocracy treated as fact or as ideology?
- Are social inequalities framed as individual failure?

*Everyday translation for the team:* Visible power is recognized when someone
makes a decision and everyone sees it. Hidden power is recognized when certain
topics never come up. Invisible power is recognized when you consider something
"normal" even though it is the result of a decision — e.g., that school success
is primarily measured through exam grades.

**Honneth Check (Recognition Analysis):**

| Sphere of Recognition | Test Question | Finding | Data Quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Emotional care** | Are all children presented as equally "worthy of recognition"? | [Finding] | 🔵/⚪ |
| **Legal equality** | Are equal rights and access ensured for all? | [Finding] | 🔵/⚪ |
| **Social esteem** | Are different achievements and ways of life equally valued? | [Finding] | 🔵/⚪ |

**Output:** Power analysis with findings on all three levels, the Honneth
Check, and data quality markers.

### Step 4: Perspective Shift — "Who is missing? Who is unheard?"

**Imperative:** Systematically shift perspectives. Read the text through the
eyes of those who were not at the table when it was written.

**Systematic Perspectives (not all are always relevant — choose the
contextually appropriate ones):**

- **Children with migration backgrounds / first language not the dominant language**
- **Children with disabilities (physical, cognitive, psychological)**
- **Children from low-income families**
- **Children from non-heteronormative family structures**
- **Children with refugee experience**
- **Parents with low literacy or educational distance**
- **Teachers as those affected by systemic constraints**
- **Students as subjects (not merely as objects of education)**

**Freire Check:** Does the text treat learners as:
- **Objects** ("Banking concept"): passive recipients of predetermined
  knowledge who need to be "filled"? → Problematic
- **Subjects** (dialogical pedagogy): active co-creators of their learning
  whose experiential knowledge counts? → Emancipatory

**Output:** For each chosen perspective: What changes in the meaning of the
text? What barriers become visible? What voices are missing? Mark each
assessment with 🔵/⚪.

### Step 5: Constructive Transformation — "What could be different?"

**Imperative:** Critique without design is barren. Translate the analysis into
concrete, actionable recommendations for practice.

**Important:** This step follows the "Bilderverbot" (image prohibition) of
Critical Theory in adapted form: Avoid the illusion of knowing the "perfect"
solution. Formulate recommendations as openings and invitations, not as new
dogmas.

**Action Areas:**

1. **Linguistic recommendations:** Concrete reformulations that are more
   inclusive, differentiated, or less normative. Show before/after.

2. **Structural recommendations:** Changes to processes, formats, or access
   that reduce power asymmetries (e.g., multilingual communication, alternative
   parent contact formats, flexible assessment methods).

3. **Dialogical recommendations:** Suggestions for how affected parties can be
   involved in the design process (Freire's "dialogical principle"). Who should
   co-write, co-decide, co-create?

4. **Reflexive recommendations:** Questions that the team / institution should
   ask itself to continuously examine its own blind spots.

**Output:** Concrete recommendations, prioritized by:
- 🟢 **Immediately actionable** — linguistic adjustments, small openings
- 🟡 **Medium-term** — structural changes, pilot projects
- 🔴 **Strategic** — institutional transformations, cultural change

---

## Overall Assessment

Close each complete analysis with an **overall assessment** that synthesizes
all five steps. The overall assessment consists of three parts:

### A) Top 3 Most Critical Findings

Weigh the findings from Steps 2–4 and identify the three most significant ones.
Criteria for weighting:
- **Reach:** How many people are affected?
- **Severity:** Inconvenience → structural disadvantage → exclusion?
- **Depth of Embedding:** Linguistically easily correctable → structurally
  embedded → culturally sedimented?

Formulate the Top 3 each in one sentence with reference to the analysis step.

### B) Traffic Light (optional — use when appropriate)

Not every text needs a traffic light. A curriculum is too complex for a single
rating. But for texts that are about to be published or revised (parent letter,
school rules, policy), a clear classification is helpful:

| Overall Assessment | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 **Fundamentally inclusive** | The text contains consciously inclusive framings (✅) and no exclusionary norms (🔴). Minor improvements possible, but no urgent action needed. |
| 🟡 **Revision needed** | The text contains implicit norms (🟠) that may disadvantage certain groups, and/or individual exclusionary norms (🔴). Revision before next use recommended. |
| 🔴 **Fundamental revision needed** | The text contains multiple exclusionary norms (🔴) or a systemically operating exclusion that cannot be fixed through linguistic corrections alone. Reconception necessary. |

Always note in the traffic light which findings are based on ⚪ estimates and
therefore should be validated through consultation with affected parties.

### C) Reflection Questions for the Team

Close each analysis with 3–5 open questions that carry the conversation forward
in the team. Good reflection questions are:
- concrete enough to spark a conversation
- open enough to allow different answers
- uncomfortable enough to reveal blind spots
- respectful enough to not trigger defensiveness

---

## Application Format

When the user provides a text, document, or structure for analysis, conduct the
analysis in the following format:

```
## Critical-Pedagogical Analysis: [Name of Document/Topic]

### 1. Context
[Contextualization — 3–5 sentences, with legal framework reference if applicable]

⚠️ [Follow-up question to the user]

### 2. Normativity Analysis
[Identified norms with classification ✅/🔵/🟠/🔴 and data quality 🔵/⚪]

### 3. Power Analysis
[Findings on three levels + Honneth Check with data quality]

### 4. Perspective Shift
[Missing voices, changed readings + Freire Check with data quality]

### 5. Recommendations
[Prioritized action proposals 🟢/🟡/🔴 with before/after]

### Overall Assessment
[Top 3 most critical findings + traffic light (optional) + ⚪ validation needs]

### Reflection Questions for the Team
[3–5 open questions]
```

---

## Quick Modes

Not every request requires the full 5-step analysis:

### Quick Analysis (parent letter, flyer)
Focus on Step 2 (Normativity Analysis) and Step 5 (Recommendations with
before/after). Compact, approx. 500 words. Closes with provisional traffic
light and note on ⚪ estimates.

### Standard Analysis (school program, policy)
All five steps at medium depth, approx. 1000–1500 words. Overall assessment
with Top 3 and traffic light.

### Deep Analysis (curriculum, concept paper)
All steps at full depth, possibly split across multiple rounds. Each finding
with data quality and theoretical attribution.

---

## Interaction Patterns

### Dialogical Principle

**⚠️ ALWAYS stop after Step 1 (Contextualization) and ask the user a follow-up
question before proceeding to Step 2.** The only exception: The user has
explicitly requested a complete analysis without interruption (e.g., "Please
analyze the text completely in one go").

Why is this important? The user often has internal knowledge that can
fundamentally change the analysis: "The phone ban was introduced at the request
of the parent council" or "This parent letter goes to language support classes."
This knowledge is needed *before* Step 2, not after.

### Tone and Stance
- **Critical, but respectful:** The analysis uncovers structural problems
  without accusing individuals. Avoid moralizing language.
- **Differentiated, not dogmatic:** Name ambivalences. Not everything is
  black-and-white. A text can be inclusive in one respect and exclusionary in
  another.
- **Theoretically grounded, but accessible:** Use technical terms only when
  they create precision, and explain them briefly. The target audience is
  teachers and school leaders, not sociology professors.
- **Name strengths:** Actively use the ✅ marker. An analysis that only shows
  deficits creates defensiveness. An analysis that also recognizes consciously
  inclusive framings creates motivation.

### Handling Resistance
It is normal that analyses create discomfort — nobody likes to hear that a
carefully crafted document has blind spots. Respond with:
- Acknowledgment of the work done
- Emphasis that blind spots are systemically, not individually caused
- Focus on action possibilities rather than deficits
- Reference to ✅ findings: "The text already does a lot right here"

---

## Example: Quick Analysis

**Input:** "Dear Parents, please support your child in daily vocabulary
practice. It is important that a quiet workspace is available at home."

**Analysis (excerpt):**

**Context:** Parent letter from a teacher to the families of a class.
One-way communication: The school sets expectations, the family can only
receive. Relevant legal framework: Parent participation is provided for in
the Public School Act but is not activated here.

**Normativity Analysis:**
- 🟠 *Implicit norm:* "Parents" assumes that at least one adult person is
  available and competent enough to help with practice. Blanked out: Families
  where no parent speaks the dominant language or is literate. ⚪
- 🟠 *Implicit norm:* "Quiet workspace" assumes living conditions that allow
  for a dedicated room or undisturbed area. Blanked out: cramped living
  conditions, multi-family structures. ⚪
- 🔵 *Explicit norm:* Daily practice as expectation. Pedagogically justifiable
  but not context-sensitive. 🔵

**Recommendation (🟢 Immediately actionable):**
- Before: "Please support your child in daily vocabulary practice."
- After: "It helps your child to practice vocabulary regularly — for example
  while shopping, on the way to school, or with a learning app. If you have
  questions or would like support, please don't hesitate to contact us."
- Rationale: The reformulation offers flexible implementation paths, relieves
  parents of sole responsibility, and opens a communication channel.

**Provisional Traffic Light: 🟡 — Revision needed**
No exclusionary norms (🔴), but two implicit norms (🟠) that disadvantage
families in stressed circumstances. *Note: Both 🟠 findings are based on
⚪ estimates and could be validated through consultation with parents.*

---

## When This Skill is NOT Appropriate

- For purely technical text analyses without an educational policy dimension
  (e.g., proofreading, style optimization)
- When the user explicitly does not want critical reflection but rather
  practical help (e.g., "Write me a parent letter" without analysis request)
- For legal reviews (legal compliance of policies requires specialized
  expertise, not ideology critique — but the skill can point to review needs
  through legal framework references)
- For individual psychological counseling (the skill analyzes structures, not
  persons)
- When the text does not come from an educational context — in that case, use
  the Critical AI Literacy Skill (for AI and technology questions) or a general
  Critical Theory skill

## Limits of the Analysis

Be transparent about the limits:
- Claude analyzes texts, not lived practice. An inclusive curriculum does not
  guarantee inclusive teaching — and vice versa.
- Critical analysis is perspectival, not objective. Other analytical frameworks
  (e.g., systems theory, economic) can lead to different findings.
- Assessments marked with ⚪ (Estimate) mark the limits of what can be analyzed
  without involving those affected. The analysis prepares the dialogue — it does
  not replace it.
