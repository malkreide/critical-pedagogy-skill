- The English version (`SKILL_EN.md`) follows standard English conventions
- Use gender-inclusive language where possible
- Explain technical terms on first use
- Tone: critical, but constructive and respectful

### Content Quality

- Correctly cite and contextualize theoretical references
- Illustrate new analysis steps or techniques with examples
- For legal references: verify legal status and specify jurisdiction
- Consider the Swiss educational context, but enable transferability to other contexts

### Technical Requirements

- `SKILL.md` and `SKILL_EN.md` must be valid Markdown
- YAML frontmatter in skill files must be correctly formatted
- Changes to the `description` in the frontmatter should improve trigger recognition

## Areas for Contribution

We are particularly interested in contributions in these areas:

- **Localization:** Adaptations for other educational systems (with appropriate legal frameworks)
- **Domain-specific extensions:** Additions for specific subjects or professions
- **Example dialogues:** Effective critical-pedagogical analyses of real-world documents
- **Evaluation metrics:** Methods for measuring analysis quality
- **Integration guides:** Instructions for various platforms
